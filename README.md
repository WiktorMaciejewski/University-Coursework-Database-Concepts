# University-Coursework-Database-Concepts
This was a task/coursework as part of my "Database Concepts" module at university.

Unfortunately, I couldn't find the document outlining the tasks that had to be completed for this exercise. 
From what I remember it was an exercise designed to introduce us to the basics of SQL and database management.
It was originally developed in "Oracle SQL-Developer".
